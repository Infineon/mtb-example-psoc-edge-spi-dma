# PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: SPI with DMA

This code example demonstrates how to utilize the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) in controller and target modes with Direct Memory Access (DMA) on PSOC&trade; Edge E84 MCU. The SPI controller is configured to send command packets to control a user LED on the target. Both the controller and target can be on the same device or on different devices.

This code example has a three project structure: CM33 secure, CM33 non-secure, and CM55 projects. All three projects are programmed to the external QSPI flash and executed in Execute in Place (XIP) mode. Extended boot launches the CM33 secure project from a fixed location in the external flash, which then configures the protection settings and launches the CM33 non-secure application. Additionally, CM33 non-secure application enables CM55 CPU and launches the CM55 application.

See the [Design and implementation](docs/design_and_implementation.md) for the functional description of this code example.


## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox&trade;](https://www.infineon.com/modustoolbox) v3.6 or later (tested with v3.6)
- Board support package (BSP) minimum required version: 1.0.0
- Programming language: C
- Associated parts: All [PSOC&trade; Edge MCU](https://www.infineon.com/products/microcontroller/32-bit-psoc-arm-cortex/32-bit-psoc-edge-arm) parts


## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm&reg; Embedded Compiler v14.2.1 (`GCC_ARM`) – Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`
- Arm&reg; Compiler v6.22 (`ARM`)
- IAR C/C++ Compiler v9.50.2 (`IAR`)
- LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm&reg; v19.1.5 (`LLVM_ARM`)


## Supported kits (make variable 'TARGET')

- [PSOC&trade; Edge E84 Evaluation Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_PSE84_EVAL) (`KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2`) – Default value of `TARGET`
- [PSOC&trade; Edge E84 Evaluation Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_PSE84_EVAL) (`KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC4`)


## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

Ensure the following jumper and pin configuration on board.
- BOOT SW must be in the HIGH/ON position
- J20 and J21 must be in the tristate/not connected (NC) position

**Table 1. SPI pin configuration**

SPI pins | controller | target
:-------|:-------|:------
SCK     | P16[0] | 8[0] 
MOSI    | P16[1] | 8[1] 
MISO    | P16[2] | 8[4] 
CS      | P16[3] | 8[2] 

<br>

Use jumper wires to establish a connection between the controller and the target on the kit as follows:

1. Connect `P16[0]` (SPI.SCK) on `J3` to `P8[0]` (I2C.SCL) on `J3`
2. Connect `P16[1]` (SPI.MOSI) on `J3` to `P8[1]` (I2C.SDA) on `J3`
3. Connect `P16[2]` (SPI.MISO) on `J3` to `P8[4]` (I2C.INT2) on `J6`
4. Connect `P16[3]` (SPI.CS) on `J3` to `P8[2]` (GPIO.0) on `J2`

In case of two separate kits for controller and target, connect the controller pins of one kit to the target pins of the other kit

> **Note:** The SPI pins can also be viewed using the Device Configurator tool.


## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

This example requires no additional software or tools.


## Operation

See [Using the code example](docs/using_the_code_example.md) for instructions on creating a project, opening it in various supported IDEs, and performing tasks, such as building, programming, and debugging the application within the respective IDEs.

You can configure this example to work in controller-only, or target-only, or both controller and target SPI modes by configuring the value of the `SPI_MODE` macro in the *interface.h* file. By default, this example is configured to work in `SPI BOTH` mode.

Ensure do the hardware connections as mentioned in the [Hardware setup](#hardware-setup) section.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

2. After programming, the application starts automatically. Observe that the kit's USER LED1 blinks at 1 Hz
